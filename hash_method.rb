What I learned yesterter day about hashes is that Hashes are useful
when data that contains information can be call by either keys and values
without going to each data using arrays.

A cool method I found very useful using hashes is hash.store, similar to push(<<). If we have a Hash
already created, I do not have to go back to the hash and add a key and value, instead,
i can use thet name of the hash, for example, hash.store(key: :value). Another method that can be use
as a second option is to use the method update, for example hash.update.

### in text editor.
