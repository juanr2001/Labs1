Reading the manual page for a unix command with man, I used rm. rm command \n
will files that does not require super user do(sudo) permission. Using rm, I can use  \n
different options that will allow me remove files an specific way. For example, typing  \n
rm -d allows me to remove directories and other file, I can also use rm -i for confimation \n
before a file deletion attempt. Notwithstanding the risk of deleting important files, rm is \n
is capable to delete files using absolute and relative path.
